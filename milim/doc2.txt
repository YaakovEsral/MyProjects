Options on the home page.
Q: what is the best approach for displaying multiple options on the home page?

first, let's clarify what exactly we want. Here are the options:
Which words to be tested on
How many choices per question (easy, medium, difficult, etc.)
How many total questions

Perhaps we would consider having a settings tab. There, the user could modify the settings,
but there would be defaults. E.g. default 6 choices (medium) and 10 questions.
The user would still select which words to be tested on.

In which words, we could simply give each group a name, e.g. B"K Gm' 2a.
Or we could also have an option to click on the category and display the words
in the group (with translations).

to start with, let's have a link to a new page 'options' that displays the options
of which words to use. we will have two groups, Group 1 and Group 2.
Each group will have a different JSON file. The JSON files will be stored in a folder
called 'json'. For now, we will hard code all our files and values.
