Capo 0-2
G       D                C           G
Look inside through the heart of a Jew
C                  D
Open up its many doors
G         D               C           G
And the soul that you'll see there inside
C                    D
Is a reflection of yours

B7  Em       Em/D#     Em/D         A/C#
    For each soul is a part of one whole,
      C               A  D
That joins us to each o-ther
G       D          Em
We are all part of one another
C                   D
And we have always been one

G      D          C           G
We are one since way back in time,
C                D
Unified at our start,
G     D        C         G
We began as a nation to live,
C                     D
And believe with one heart

B7  Em     Em/D#
    You and I, 
        Em/D          A/C#
We were all gathered there,
    C                   A       D
As one, we said, “We’ll do and hear”.
G        D         Em
We were born to belong together,
C           D
And forever be one…

Chorus
   G                    G/F#
Forever one, we will go far,
G/F                      C/E
It’s not I am but who we are,
    Cm             G
We need just to reveal it,
            A       C   D
We need to try and feel it

     G            G/F#
And never are we alone,
G/F                        C
We have each other as our own,
Cm             G
Nothing can divide us,
       A       C D   G
For we are, forever one

G          D               C             G
These are times when we might drift apart,
C                       D
And go our own separate ways
G         D          C             G
But the spark from Above that we share,
C               D
Is alive and ablaze.

B7  Em         Em/D#
       Soon Moshiach 
     Em/D        A/C#
Will gather each spark,
     C              A   D
And shine away the darkness.
G        D         Em
He will gather us all together,
C                 D
And we shall ever be one…


Chorus
   G                    G/F#
Forever one, we will go far,
G/F                      C/E
It’s not I am but who we are,
    Cm             G
We need just to reveal it,
            A       C   D
We need to try and feel it

     G            G/F#
And never are we alone,
G/F                        C
We have each other as our own,
Cm             G
Nothing can divide us,
       A       C D   G
For we are, forever one
