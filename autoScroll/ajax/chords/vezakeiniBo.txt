Capo 3
       G       D     C
As I stand in candlelight
         Em     D       C
With my hands upon my eyes
           Am     E       Am
There’s a passion in my prayers
C                D
That rends the skies
                           G      D
For a mother’s tears can shatter
                 Em            C
Every gate that bars the way
         Am          Bm
All the heavens will echo 
       C                  B
Those words that mothers say

Chorus:
     Em         D
Vezakeini vezakeini
          Bm             C
Take my children by the hand
           Am              D
Help them walk along Your way
          B
May they never go astray
           Em            D
May they know You as I know You
       Bm              C
Oh Hashem, accept my plea
          Am                  D
Give me children who’ll give nachas
Bm      C  D  Em
Vezakeini

       G       D     C
As I stand in candlelight
         Em      D         C
While my home is dark and still
          Am      E       Am
There’s a void inside my heart
C          D
I long to fill
                G       D
Will I ever be mother
                   Em           C
Will that blessing come my way
        Am           Bm
Will I stand by the candles
       C             B
With gratitude and pray
