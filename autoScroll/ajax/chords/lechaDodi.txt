      Em           C
It’s leil Shabbos koidesh
    D          G
He wanders on in
  Am           B
Stands in the back
          B       Em
As the tefilos begin
    Em        C
The mystical words
    D       G
Of lecha dodi
         Am         D
There’s something about
       Bm      Em
That sweet melody

  Em         C
Invited for dinner
   D          G
Zemiros they sing
   Am          B
Infusing his soul
          B              Em
With the joy that they bring
  Em         C
Closing his eyes
      D               G
His heart starts to soar
    Am          D
Perhaps we can sing
       Bm             Em
That sweet song once more


Chorus:
   Am             Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
   D             G   E
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah
   Am              Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
        D        Bm  Em
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah

     Em             C
They asked him who are you
      D             G
And where were you born
   Am          B
Ramallah’s my home
       B           Em
But inside I feel torn
       Em             C
I was taught to hate Jews
    D           G
To hurt and to maim
       Am        D
But I felt a connection 
    Bm          Em
I could not explain

     Em         C
With anger and fury
        D         G
Thrown out of my home
    Am           B
Confused and forsaken
   B          Em
I left there alone
       Em               C
But I feel something strange here
     D               G
His voice fills the room
    Am       D
And over and over 
      Bm           Em
He’s singing this tune


Chorus:
   Am             Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
   D             G   E
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah
   Am              Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
        D        Bm  Em
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah

   Em           C
Returned to my mother 
    D          G
To say my goodbyes
     Am           B
She told me the truth
      B            Em
With tears in her eyes
       Em       C
I was taken by force
       D           G
We’re Jewish, now run
          Am          D
Here’s a picture to treasure
       Bm            Em
It’s where you come from

      Em            C
They gathered and stared
         D       G
At the photo he held
   Am             B
An image of his grandfather’s
  B         Em
Grave it beheld
       Em     C
Rav Shlomo Alkabetz
     D         G
His kever in Tzfas
      Am         D
Who wrote lecha dodi 
    Bm           Em
We sing leil Shabbos


Chorus:
   Am             Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
   D             G   E
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah
   Am              Em
Lecha dodi likras kallah
        D        Bm  Em
Pinei Shabbos nikabelah
